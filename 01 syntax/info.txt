
We will see the differnce in the syntax of scss and sass. scss is sassy CSS.
Main differences:
SCSS:
It is the extension of basic or plain css. SO any valid css is also scss file. So in scss file we can write css.

SASS:
SASS is also a extentions of css but we can do more with it like nesting, variables etc.
But it is very syntactically different.
Example SASS instead of semicolons SAAS uses new line to separate properties. So it's not compatible with CSS. Alos we
use indentation insted of brackets.
